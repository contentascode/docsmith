# Docsmith

Docsmith is a javascript based implementation of the content as code framework depending on metalsmith and pandoc.

It provides an executable which coordinates various aspects of content authoring, previewing and publishing.

It has been used in its past versions for:
 - Panic Button
 - Open Mentoring
 - Security in a Box

It can be used standalone with the `content` command and can be used as an alias (white label) for specific project uses (instances).

In its current version, the safetag project makes use of the aliasing capabilities.
